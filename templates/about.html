    <h1>The Health Advisor Machine</h1>
    <p>The Health Advisor Machine is a group project in machine learning that
        aims to predict the likelihood of several health conditions, including diabetes,
        heart attack, cancer, depression, Alzheimer's, and “craziness” conditions.
        The team members include Dhannya Mohan Geetha, Kesha Patel, and Trung Tran.

    <p>To accomplish the project goals, the team utilized several technologies such as Amazon S3,
        Amazon DynamoDB,Amazon EC2, Amazon Kubernetes EKS, Python, Panda, Pyspark, Flask Web Application,
        HTML, Bootstrap, Docker, and Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>The team gathered datasets from Kaggle, which contained over 100,000 records.
        They then applied machine learning models, including logistic regression,
        random forest regression, and decision tree models, to determine the best model for
        predicting the likelihood of each health condition. We chose the best models that
        have accuracy around 85% and up to apply into our application.
    </p>
    <p>The Health Advisor Machine project aims to provide individuals with personalized
        health advice and insights to help them take proactive steps to improve their
        health and well-being. However, this project is designed for learning experience only.
        Please consult your healthcare providers if you have health problems.
